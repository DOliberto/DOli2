* build
  you need python 3 and =virtualenv= installed.
  : $ virtualenv venv
  will create a virtual environment at the current directory.

  to activate it,
  : $ source venv/bin/activate
  and you'll be inside the virtual environment.

  to quit the virtual environment, just do
  : $ deactivate

* usage
  : $ flask shell
  will run a python shell with the flask app already setup (everything
  imported, variables set, etc.)
  : $ flask run
  will run the flask app on localhost. this requires setting the
  =FLASK_APP= variable with
  : $ export FLASK_APP=doli.py
  setting flask on debug mode is also useful:
